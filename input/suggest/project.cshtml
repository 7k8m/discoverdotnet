    <p>
        Note that for many projects, you'll only need to provide the <code>SourceCode</code>, <code>NuGet</code>, and <code>Language</code> fields.
        The rest of the data is automatically pulled from the GitHub API if available. Other fields that aren't represented
        in GitHub like <code>Image</code> and <code>Chat</code> should also be provided.
